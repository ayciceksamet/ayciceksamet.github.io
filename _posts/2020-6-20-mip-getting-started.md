Computer vision, image and video processing, these have always been trending topics in software development area. I have started my computer vision adventure using Matlab and Script Programming in the early 2010. 

I am very thrilled when see the value of matrices that taken from imported image on my screen. And processing them is really fascinating thing that I have ever seen in coding world. Afterwards, Java, Python and C++ are my best friends in this journey within OpenCV library.

OpenCV is the Swiss army knife of libraries to developers which working on computer vision. I have developed lot of projects then, this also helps me to improve my software coding techniques and my creativity. Now that I found my dream area, for the first time in my life I feel really fulfilled.

A webcam or external camera is needed to take images to process. Using faster sensors and camera is essential thing to get exact frames on computer vision area. There are numerous device manufacturer in camera industry. They are in a race to produce camera having better quality, fps and high speed. 

While developing a computer vision solution system, all you need : 

- Operating System ( Windows, Linux, Embedded Linux, Raspberry Pi OS etc. )
- Hardware ( PC, Laptop, Embedded system, Raspberry Pi etc. )
- Camera ( Webcam, External Camera, Embedded Camera in boards etc. )

Imagine that all you demand is compact and combined ðŸ™‚ Of course, each solution has several capacity and performance and any specific system serves different purposes.. I just want to emphasize that development with mobile environment is enjoyable, ergonomic and painless. 

You can practice in computer vision while drinking your coffee in a store just along your mobile phone and laptop.
