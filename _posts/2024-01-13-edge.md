Edge AI is transforming how computer vision applications are deployed, particularly for mobile and IoT devices. By processing data locally, edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy.

My first project with edge AI involved implementing a face recognition system on a Raspberry Pi. Watching it perform real-time detections was nothing short of amazing.

Some benefits of edge AI include:

- Faster response times.
- Reduced data transfer costs.
- Increased security and privacy.
