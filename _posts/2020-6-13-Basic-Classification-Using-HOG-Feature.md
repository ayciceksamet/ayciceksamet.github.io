title: how to solve basic classification problem
---

Today, we will learn **how to solve basic classification problem** with using HOG Features. 

In traditional computer vision techniques, there are these steps:

- preprocessing of image
- extracting features 
- labeling with pre-defined formulas using features

In addition to traditional techniques, we will add a step **ML and DL** in our detection system.

Firstly, lets divide our case into steps :
