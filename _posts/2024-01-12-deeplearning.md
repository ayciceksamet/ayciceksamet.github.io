As deep learning models grow larger and more complex, running them on mobile devices introduces unique challenges. From hardware limitations to software compatibility, there are hurdles to overcome.

I faced these challenges firsthand while deploying a neural network for facial recognition on Android. Optimizing it without compromising accuracy was a steep learning curve.

Some key challenges in mobile deep learning include:

- **Model Size:** Handling large models on limited storage.
- **Inference Time:** Reducing delays during predictions.
- **Battery Consumption:** Ensuring models run efficiently without draining power.
