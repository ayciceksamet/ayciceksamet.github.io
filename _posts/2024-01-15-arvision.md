Augmented Reality (AR) is redefining how we interact with our surroundings. Integrating mobile computer vision with AR applications is a fascinating domain with endless possibilities.

My journey into AR began when I experimented with feature tracking and object overlay on video feeds. Combining OpenCV with ARKit made it possible to create interactive and immersive experiences.

Some promising use cases of AR with mobile computer vision include:

- Virtual furniture placement.
- Interactive learning environments.
- Enhancing navigation systems.
