Mobile devices are becoming increasingly powerful, but optimizing image processing tasks to run efficiently on them requires special considerations. From resource management to algorithm design, many factors play a role in creating effective solutions.

My first experience with mobile optimization was in 2015 when I attempted to run an object detection model on an entry-level smartphone. Watching the model work on limited hardware was a rewarding challenge.

Key aspects to consider while optimizing for mobile devices include:

- **Model Compression:** Techniques like quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation are essential.
- **Hardware Utilization:** Leveraging mobile GPUs and NPUs.
- **Latency and Power Consumption:** Balancing performance and battery life.

With advancements in hardware and frameworks like TensorFlow Lite and ONNX, mobile optimization is no longer just a dream; it's becoming the standard.
