Real-time object tracking on mobile devices opens doors to numerous applications, from security to gaming. Achieving low-latency performance while maintaining high accuracy is the ultimate goal.

I remember the excitement of implementing my first real-time tracking system on a mobile device. By optimizing algorithms like Kalman filters and YOLO, I achieved surprising results.
